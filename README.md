gedit-smartbox
==============

An smart box to launch commands, open documents etc. The main idea is a
main plugin to manage the box but it has not functionallity. Other plugins
can register providers in gedit-smartbox and provide options to select
in the smart box. 

By the moment, my other plugin "gedit-stproject" will register a provider 
to open files in the current project easily, another plugin could register
a provider to show symbols to go to, an option to "go to header file" etc.
